-- Create the ecommerce database

create database ecommerce;

-- Create the customers table

create table customers(
 id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
 name varchar(255) not null,
 email varchar(255) unique not null,
 address text
);




-- Create the products table

create table products(
id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name varchar(255) not null,
price decimal(10,2) not null,
description text
);



-- Create the orders table

create table orders(
id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id int,
order_date date,
total_amount decimal(10,2),
foreign key(customer_id) references customers(id)
);




-- Insert sample data into customers

insert into customers (name,email,address) values
('aji','aji@gmail.com','123 main st'),
('mano','mano@gmail.com','456 main st');




-- Insert sample data into products

insert into products (name,price,description) values
('product a',20.00,'description of product a'),
('product b',30.00,'description of product b'),
('product c',40.00,'description of product c');



-- Insert sample data into orders

insert into orders (customer_id,order_date,total_amount) values
(1,curdate(),100.00),
(2,curdate() - interval 20 day,150.00);



-- Query 1: Retrieve all customers who have placed an order in the last 30 days
-- This query selects distinct customers who have placed at least one order in the last 30 days.


select distinct c.* from customers c
join orders o on c.id = o.customer_id
where o.order_date >= curdate() - interval 30 day;



-- Query 2: Get the total amount of all orders placed by each customer
-- This query calculates the total spending for each customer by summing up their order amounts.

select c.name, sum(o.total_amount) as total_spent
from customers c
join orders o on c.id = o.customer_id
group by c.id;




-- Query 3: Update the price of Product C to 45.00
-- This query updates the price of 'Product C' to 45.00 in the products table.


update products set price = 50.00 where name = 'product c';




-- Query 4: Add a new column discount to the products table
-- This query adds a new column 'discount' to store discount information for products.


alter table products add column discount decimal(5,2) default 0.00;



-- Query 5: Retrieve the top 3 products with the highest price
-- This query fetches the top 3 most expensive products based on price.

select * from products order by price desc limit 3;



-- Query 6: Get the names of customers who have ordered Product A
-- This query finds all customers who have ordered 'Product A' by joining relevant tables.

select distinct c.name from customers c 
join orders o on c.id = o.customer_id
join order_items oi on o.id = oi .order_id
join products p on oi.product_id = p.id
where p.name ='product a';




-- Query 7: Join orders and customers to retrieve the customer's name and order date
-- This query retrieves customer names along with the dates they placed orders.

select c.name, o.order_date from customers c
join orders o on c.id = o.customer_id;




-- Query 8: Retrieve orders with a total amount greater than 150.00
-- This query selects all orders where the total amount exceeds 150.00.

select * from orders where total_amount > 150.00;





-- Normalization: Create an order_items table and update orders to reference it
-- This step normalizes the database by creating an 'order_items' table for handling multiple products in an order.

create table order_items(
id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
order_id int,
product_id int,
quantity int default 1,
price decimal(10,2),
foreign key (order_id) references orders(id),
foreign key (product_id) references products(id)
);

alter table orders drop column total_amount;


-- Query 10: Retrieve the average total of all orders
-- This query calculates the average total amount of all orders placed in the system.

select avg(total_amount) as average_order_total from orders;
